Coursera: Functional Programming Principles in Scala
====================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/drolando/scala-coursera.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/drolando/scala-coursera)

*This course introduces the cornerstones of functional programming using the Scala programming language. Functional
programming has become more and more popular in recent years because it promotes code that’s safe, concise, and elegant.
Furthermore, functional programming makes it easier to write parallel code for today’s and tomorrow’s multiprocessors
by replacing mutable variables and loops with powerful ways to define and compose functions.*

*In this course you will discover the elements of the functional programming style and learn how to apply them usefully
in your daily programming tasks. You will also develop a solid foundation for reasoning about functional programs,
by touching upon proofs of invariants and the tracing of execution symbolically.*

This repository contains my solutions for the projects for the
[Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun1) course on
[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

## Assignments
1. [Recursion](https://github.com/drolando/scala-coursera/tree/master/recfun): simple exercises on recursion: print Pascal's triangle and parenthesis balancing.
2. [Higher Order Functions](https://github.com/drolando/scala-coursera/tree/master/funsets): in this assignment, you will work with a functional representation of sets based on the mathematical notion of characteristic functions. The goal is to gain practice with higher-order functions.
